# The /tutor Command - Complete Reference

The `/tutor` command is the unified interface for managing all tutors in this project.

---

## Command Syntax

```
/tutor <subcommand> [arguments]
```

## Available Subcommands

| Subcommand | Syntax | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `list` | `/tutor list` | Display all available tutors organized by type |
| `describe` | `/tutor describe <name>` | Show detailed information about a specific tutor |
| `combine` | `/tutor combine <A> <B>` | Merge two tutors into a new combined tutor |
| `create` | `/tutor create <name>` | Interactively create a new tutor |
| `activate` | `/tutor activate <name>` | Activate a tutor (equivalent to `/output-style <name>`) |
| `delete` | `/tutor delete <name>` | Delete a tutor (with confirmation) |

---

## Tutor Types

Every tutor file has a `type` field in its YAML frontmatter that classifies it:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `method` | Defines HOW to teach (pedagogy) | socratic, eli5, rubber-duck, minimalist |
| `topic` | Defines WHAT to teach (domain) | python-tutor, git-tutor, stock-indicators-tutor |
| `combined` | Generated by `/tutor combine` | socratic-python-tutor, eli5-git-tutor |

**Why this matters:**
- `/tutor list` uses this to categorize tutors
- `/tutor combine` uses this to validate combinations and order filenames
- Users can quickly understand what each tutor does

---

## Subcommand Details

### `/tutor list`

**Purpose:** Display all available tutors organized by type.

**Usage:**
```
/tutor list
```

**How It Works:**

For fast performance, `/tutor list` infers tutor types from **filenames only** (no file reads):
- **Known methods**: `socratic`, `eli5`, `rubber-duck`, `minimalist`, `challenge-first` → method
- **Ends with `-tutor`**: `python-tutor`, `git-tutor` → topic
- **Contains a known method + another part**: `socratic-python-tutor` → combined
- **Anything else**: → topic (default)

**Output Format:**
```
Teaching Methods:
  challenge-first, eli5, minimalist, rubber-duck, socratic

Topic Tutors:
  git-tutor, python-tutor, stock-indicators-tutor

Combined Tutors:
  eli5-stock-indicators-tutor, socratic-python-tutor
  [or "None yet - run /tutor combine to create"]

Use /tutor describe <name> for details.
```

**Note:** Descriptions are not shown in the list (for speed). Use `/tutor describe <name>` to see details.

---

### `/tutor describe <name>`

**Purpose:** Show detailed information about a specific tutor.

**Usage:**
```
/tutor describe socratic
/tutor describe python-tutor
```

**Output Format:**
```
TUTOR: socratic
TYPE: method
DESCRIPTION: Teaches through guiding questions - never gives direct answers

CORE CONSTRAINT:
  Never provide direct answers. Guide the user to discover answers
  themselves through carefully crafted questions.

FILE: .claude/output-styles/socratic.md
```

**Error Handling:**
- If tutor not found: "Tutor 'foo' not found. Run /tutor list to see available tutors."

---

### `/tutor combine <A> <B>`

**Purpose:** Merge two tutors into a new combined tutor.

**Expected Usage:** Combine a METHOD with a TOPIC:
```
/tutor combine socratic python-tutor
/tutor combine eli5 git-tutor
```

**What Gets Created:**
- A new file in `.claude/output-styles/` with `type: combined`
- Contains merged behaviors from both tutors
- User is instructed to activate it

#### Naming Normalization Rules

To prevent duplicate files (e.g., both `socratic-python-tutor.md` and `python-tutor-socratic.md`), the command normalizes output filenames:

| Input Types | Naming Rule | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| method + topic | METHOD-TOPIC | `socratic-python-tutor.md` |
| topic + method | METHOD-TOPIC (swapped) | `socratic-python-tutor.md` |
| method + method | Alphabetical | `eli5-socratic.md` |
| topic + topic | Alphabetical | `git-tutor-python-tutor.md` |

**Examples:**
```
/tutor combine socratic python-tutor  → socratic-python-tutor.md
/tutor combine python-tutor socratic  → socratic-python-tutor.md (same file!)
/tutor combine socratic eli5          → eli5-socratic.md (alphabetical)
/tutor combine python-tutor git-tutor → git-tutor-python-tutor.md (alphabetical)
```

#### Validation and Warnings

The command validates combinations and warns about unusual cases:

| Combination | Validation | User Prompt |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| method + topic | Valid | (none - proceeds directly) |
| topic + method | Valid | (none - swaps order, proceeds) |
| method + method | Warning | "Both are teaching methods. Combining may produce conflicting instructions. Proceed anyway? (y/n)" |
| topic + topic | Warning | "Both are topic tutors. Combining will mix domains. Proceed anyway? (y/n)" |

**Philosophy:** Warn but don't block. Users may have creative reasons for unusual combinations.

#### Existence Checking

If the normalized output file already exists:

```
/tutor combine socratic python-tutor
> "socratic-python-tutor already exists. Regenerate? (y/n)"
```

- If "y": Overwrites the existing file
- If "n": Aborts without changes

**This applies regardless of input order:**
```
# If socratic-python-tutor.md exists:
/tutor combine socratic python-tutor     → "Already exists. Regenerate?"
/tutor combine python-tutor socratic     → "Already exists. Regenerate?" (same check!)
```

#### Error Handling

**Missing tutor file:**
```
/tutor combine foo python-tutor

> "Tutor 'foo' not found.
>
>  Available methods: socratic, rubber-duck, eli5, challenge-first, minimalist
>  Available topics: python-tutor, git-tutor, stock-indicators-tutor
>
>  Run /tutor create foo to create a new tutor."
```

---

### `/tutor create <name>`

**Purpose:** Interactively create a new tutor.

**Usage:**
```
/tutor create deep-dive
/tutor create music-tutor
```

**Interactive Flow:**

1. **Check existence:**
   ```
   > "Tutor 'deep-dive' already exists. Overwrite? (y/n)"
   ```

2. **Infer or ask type:**
   - If name contains "-tutor" → suggests "topic"
   - If name matches known pedagogy terms → suggests "method"
   - Otherwise → asks user:
   ```
   > "Is 'deep-dive' a teaching METHOD or a TOPIC tutor?
   >  1. Method (defines HOW to teach - like socratic, eli5)
   >  2. Topic (defines WHAT to teach - like python-tutor, git-tutor)"
   ```

3. **For METHOD style, asks:**
   - "What is the core teaching approach?"
   - "What constraint defines this method?"
   - "Provide an example interaction (optional)"

4. **For TOPIC tutor, asks:**
   - "What domain/subject does this tutor cover?"
   - "Who is the target user? What do they already know?"
   - "What should this tutor NOT do?"

5. **Generates and saves:**
   - Creates `.claude/output-styles/<name>.md`
   - Confirms: "Created <name>. Run /tutor activate <name> to use it."

---

### `/tutor activate <name>`

**Purpose:** Activate a tutor (convenience wrapper).

**Usage:**
```
/tutor activate socratic
```

**Output:**
```
> "To activate 'socratic', run:
>  /output-style socratic"
```

**Why not auto-activate?** Slash commands cannot directly invoke other slash commands. This subcommand provides discoverability and clear instructions.

---

### `/tutor delete <name>`

**Purpose:** Delete a tutor file (with confirmation).

**Usage:**
```
/tutor delete test-tutor
```

**Flow:**
1. Checks if the tutor exists
2. Asks for confirmation before deleting
3. Deletes the file if confirmed

**Example:**
```
/tutor delete test-tutor

> Delete tutor 'test-tutor'? This cannot be undone.
> [Yes, delete it]

Deleted 'test-tutor'.
```

**Error Handling:**
- If tutor not found: "Tutor 'foo' not found. Run /tutor list to see available tutors."
- If no name provided: "Usage: /tutor delete <name>"

**Safety:** Always requires confirmation. Cannot be undone.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I exit/deactivate a tutor and return to normal Claude?

**A:** Run the following command to return to default behavior:
```
/output-style Default
```
This deactivates any active tutor and restores Claude's standard responses.

---

### Q: I created a new tutor but it doesn't appear in /tutor list. Why?

**A:** Claude Code caches the list of available output styles at startup. After creating a new tutor with `/tutor create` or `/tutor combine`:
1. Exit Claude Code (type `exit` or press Ctrl+C)
2. Restart Claude Code with `claude`
3. Run `/tutor list` again - your new tutor should appear

**Note:** The tutor file exists immediately and can be activated with `/output-style <name>` even before restarting - you just won't see it in the list until you restart.

---

### Q: What if I type the tutors in the wrong order?

**A:** The command normalizes automatically. Both commands below produce the same file:
```
/tutor combine socratic python-tutor  → socratic-python-tutor.md
/tutor combine python-tutor socratic  → socratic-python-tutor.md
```

### Q: What if the combined tutor already exists?

**A:** You're prompted to regenerate or abort:
```
> "socratic-python-tutor already exists. Regenerate? (y/n)"
```

### Q: What if I combine two methods or two topics?

**A:** You get a warning explaining the potential issue, but can proceed if you confirm:
```
/tutor combine eli5 socratic
> "Both are teaching methods. Combining eli5 + socratic may produce
>  conflicting instructions. Proceed anyway? (y/n)"
```

### Q: What if a tutor file doesn't have a `type` field?

**A:** The command treats it as `type: topic` by default (backward compatibility with existing tutors before this feature was added).

### Q: What if I try to combine a tutor with itself?

**A:** Error message:
```
/tutor combine socratic socratic
> "Cannot combine a tutor with itself."
```

### Q: Why doesn't /tutor list show descriptions?

**A:** For performance. `/tutor list` only reads filenames (via Glob), not file contents. This makes it very fast even with many tutors. Use `/tutor describe <name>` to see the full description and details of any tutor.

---

### Q: What naming convention should I use for new tutors?

**A:** All lowercase with hyphens. **This is important for type inference:**
- Methods: `socratic`, `eli5`, `rubber-duck`, `challenge-first`
- Topics: Must end with `-tutor`: `python-tutor`, `git-tutor`, `music-tutor`
- Combined: Method + topic: `socratic-python-tutor`, `eli5-git-tutor`
- No spaces, no underscores, no camelCase

**Why it matters:** `/tutor list` infers types from filenames. If your topic tutor doesn't end with `-tutor`, it may be miscategorized.

### Q: Where are tutor files stored?

**A:** All tutor files live in `.claude/output-styles/`:
```
.claude/output-styles/
├── socratic.md              # method
├── eli5.md                  # method
├── python-tutor.md          # topic
├── git-tutor.md             # topic
└── socratic-python-tutor.md # combined (generated)
```

### Q: Can I manually edit a combined tutor?

**A:** Yes. Combined tutors are regular markdown files. However, if you run `/tutor combine` again with the same inputs and choose "Regenerate", your manual edits will be overwritten.

### Q: How do I delete a tutor?

**A:** Use the delete subcommand:
```
/tutor delete <name>
```
You'll be asked to confirm before the file is deleted. This cannot be undone.
