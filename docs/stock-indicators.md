# Complete List of Fundamental and Technical Indicators for Evaluating US Stocks

This document provides a comprehensive list of fundamental and technical indicators used for evaluating US stocks. It includes both widely used (core) indicators and less common or advanced ones. The list is organized by category for clarity.

**Last Updated**: January 11, 2026  
**Note**: Fundamental indicators focus on a company's intrinsic value and financial health (long-term investing). Technical indicators use price and volume data for short-term trading patterns. Always use multiple indicators in context—no single indicator is definitive.
