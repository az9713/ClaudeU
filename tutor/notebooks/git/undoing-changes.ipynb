    "Here's a quick guide for which undo command to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 1: Modified a file, want to discard changes\n",
    "**Command:** `git restore <file>` (or `git checkout -- <file>`)\n",
    "- Changes were never committed\n",
    "- ⚠️ Destructive: changes are lost forever\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2: Staged a file (git add), want to unstage\n",
    "**Command:** `git restore --staged <file>` (or `git reset HEAD <file>`)\n",
    "- File changes are kept\n",
    "- Only removes from staging area\n",
    "- Safe: no data loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 3: Committed locally, want to undo (NOT pushed yet)\n",
    "**Command:** `git reset`\n",
    "- `--soft` = Keep changes staged (recommit with new message)\n",
    "- `--mixed` = Keep changes unstaged (re-organize commits)\n",
    "- `--hard` = Throw away changes completely\n",
    "- Rewrites history (don't use on pushed commits!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 4: Committed AND pushed, want to undo\n",
    "**Command:** `git revert <commit>`\n",
    "- Creates a new commit that undoes the changes\n",
    "- Doesn't rewrite history\n",
    "- Safe for shared repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 5: Need to switch tasks temporarily\n",
    "**Command:** `git stash`\n",
    "- Saves uncommitted changes\n",
    "- Use `git stash pop` to restore them later\n",
    "- Like putting work in a drawer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 6: Accidentally deleted commits\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Don't panic!** Git's reflog keeps \"deleted\" commits for ~30 days\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Restoring files:**\n",
    "   - `git restore <file>` - Discard working directory changes\n",
    "   - `git restore --staged <file>` - Unstage files\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reset modes (for local commits):**\n",
    "   - `--soft` = Move HEAD, keep staging and working directory\n",
    "   - `--mixed` = Move HEAD, reset staging, keep working directory (default)\n",
    "   - `--hard` = Move HEAD, reset everything (dangerous!)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Revert vs Reset:**\n",
    "   - `reset` = Rewrites history (use for unpushed commits)\n",
    "   - `revert` = Creates new commit (safe for pushed commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stash = Temporary drawer:**\n",
    "   - Save work without committing\n",
    "   - Perfect for switching contexts\n",
    "   - `git stash` → do other work → `git stash pop`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reflog = Your safety net:**\n",
    "   - Records all HEAD movements\n",
    "   - Can recover \"lost\" commits\n",
    "   - Check it before panicking!\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Rule of thumb:**\n",
    "   - Pushed commits → use `revert`\n",
    "   - Local commits → `reset` is fine\n",
    "   - When in doubt → `stash` or make a backup branch"
