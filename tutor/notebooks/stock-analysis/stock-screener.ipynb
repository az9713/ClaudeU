    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Screening = Filtering**: Start with thousands of stocks, narrow to a few dozen\n",
    "2. **Combine Factors**: Use multiple criteria (value + quality + momentum) for better results\n",
    "3. **AND vs OR**: `&` requires all conditions, `|` requires at least one\n",
    "4. **No Magic Formula**: Different strategies work in different market conditions\n",
    "5. **Starting Point**: Screens don't tell you what to buy—they tell you what to research\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try screening with different factors:\n",
    "   - Dividend yield (`info.get('dividendYield')`)\n",
    "   - Profit margin (`info.get('profitMargins')`)\n",
    "   - Debt-to-equity (`info.get('debtToEquity')`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Screen a larger universe (S&P 500 tickers)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Backtest your screen: Would stocks that passed your screen 1 year ago have outperformed?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combine with fundamental analysis: Use screening to find candidates, then manually research them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
