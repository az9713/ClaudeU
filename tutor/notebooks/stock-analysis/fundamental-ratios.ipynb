    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Valuation Ratios** (P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA)\n",
    "   - Tell you if a stock is expensive or cheap\n",
    "   - Must compare within same industry\n",
    "   - Lower is generally better (but consider context)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Profitability Ratios** (ROE, ROA, Margins)\n",
    "   - Tell you if the business is good at making money\n",
    "   - Higher is better\n",
    "   - ROE > 15% and Net Margin > 10% are strong\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combined Analysis**\n",
    "   - Don't use ratios in isolation\n",
    "   - Best investments: Good business (high profitability) at fair price (moderate valuation)\n",
    "   - Red flag: High valuation + low profitability\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Limitations**\n",
    "   - Ratios use historical data (backward-looking)\n",
    "   - Don't capture future potential or risks\n",
    "   - Different industries have different norms\n",
    "   - Can be manipulated through accounting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps in Your Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Practice**: Analyze 20+ stocks across different sectors\n",
    "2. **Compare**: Within industries (tech vs tech, banks vs banks)\n",
    "3. **Track**: Watch how ratio changes correlate with stock performance\n",
    "4. **Expand**: Learn about cash flow analysis, competitive moats, qualitative factors\n",
    "5. **Combine**: Use with technical analysis for timing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips from Real Analysts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Warren Buffett**: Focuses on ROE and sustainable competitive advantages\n",
    "- **Peter Lynch**: Likes PEG < 1 (growth at reasonable price)\n",
    "- **Benjamin Graham**: Pioneered value investing using P/E and P/B\n",
    "- **Modern approach**: Combine quantitative (ratios) with qualitative (business quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Journey Continues\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental analysis is a skill that improves with practice. The more companies you analyze, the better you'll get at:\n",
    "- Spotting patterns\n",
    "- Identifying outliers\n",
    "- Understanding what metrics matter most for different types of businesses\n",
    "- Developing your own investment philosophy\n",
